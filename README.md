## Features of the application

1. <p align="justify">The website revolves around enabling women to post specific home-made products they want to sell like pottery, embroidered materials, paintings, knitted clothing, healthy home-made snacks, etc. or even services that they can provide. Clients, based on their nearby locations, can view their uploaded products/services & contact them if they wish to purchase or seek services by registering their interest on the portal.</p>

2. <p align="justify">The Ask Desk section enables women to ask & solve their genuine queries & get advice on social & personal concerns, hence helping them to be future-ready.</p>

3. <p align="justify">We have implemented sentiment analysis to avoid usage of abusive words or spread of hate on the portal.</p>

4. <p align="justify">To stay updated about how women are progressing in different fields, there is a section of news and articles of their latest success stories thus motivating our future entrepreneurs.</p>

5. <p align="justify">To prevent exploitation of users or misuse of the application, there‚Äôs an in-built SOS feature to connect helplines in case of emergency.</p>

6. <p align="justify">We have also created a PWA (Progressive Web App) for easy phone accessibility.</p>

## üíª Project Methodology

The software was developed using **scrum framework** in **agile methodology**. 
</br></br>
This was done to ensure that the main focus was on the software product. The exact list of features were not exactly known since the start and hence it was very necessary that the whole process was able to accommodate change easily. 
</br></br>
The project was released in 2 sprints, and each sprint was further divided into 3 phases-

- Planning and prototyping: I used a method of prototyping by first designing the UI on Figma and then after final approval, the implementation of it on the desktop application
- Implementation
- Testing and review: After each sprint, I discussed my progress with my mentors, and improved my project based on their feedback.

## üìà Deployment

The backend is deployed using **Heroku**. The deployment follows a CI/CD pipeline in which, a successful push to the main branch of the github repository runs a github action which in turn runs a series of unit tests which were written, and only on passing the tests successfully the latest code is deployed to Heroku.
