# Edurizon ~ Igniting a Better Future

## A submission for Microsoft Engage'21

<p align="justify">Edurizon is a one-stop fully functional hosted web application for smooth and extensive collaboration and engagement between teachers and students in this virtual era of learning and education. This prototype is built using agile methodologies as a part of the Microsoft Engage Mentorship Program 2021. From seamless video conferencing for classes and submitting assignments to a discussion’s forum and an interactive office hours meet, this application has some of the most essential features required to make teaching and learning a fun process remotely!
</p>

## Features of the application

1. <p align="justify">The website revolves around enabling women to post specific home-made products they want to sell like pottery, embroidered materials, paintings, knitted clothing, healthy home-made snacks, etc. or even services that they can provide. Clients, based on their nearby locations, can view their uploaded products/services & contact them if they wish to purchase or seek services by registering their interest on the portal.</p>

2. <p align="justify">The Ask Desk section enables women to ask & solve their genuine queries & get advice on social & personal concerns, hence helping them to be future-ready.</p>

3. <p align="justify">We have implemented sentiment analysis to avoid usage of abusive words or spread of hate on the portal.</p>

4. <p align="justify">To stay updated about how women are progressing in different fields, there is a section of news and articles of their latest success stories thus motivating our future entrepreneurs.</p>

5. <p align="justify">To prevent exploitation of users or misuse of the application, there’s an in-built SOS feature to connect helplines in case of emergency.</p>

6. <p align="justify">We have also created a PWA (Progressive Web App) for easy phone accessibility.</p>


#### An attempt to keep dying Indian artifact culture alive

<p align="justify">It is no secret that today some of the most flourishing handicraft and artifact industries once started as small in-house businesses and initiatives taken up by women. But often socially backward women are not given a chance to prove their mettle which leads to the economic downfall as well as heritage loss of the country. As modernisation is transforming the nation, we almost fail to appreciate India’s traditional artifact culture that it was once famous for. Simple and beautiful handmade goods are overlooked and prioritized by imported and branded fancy goods as the country is growing economically. This is an effort from our side to help preserve India’s dying craft culture and uplift the artists who deserve to get much more success and recognition behind the efforts they are putting in the form of their passion and expertise.</p>
